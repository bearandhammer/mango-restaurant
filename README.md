## 1.1. Introduction

Repository containing tracking the creation of a project looking at ASP.NET Core Microservices with Azure Service Bus, which relates to this Udemy course: [.NET Core Microservices - The Complete Guide (.NET 6 MVC)](https://www.udemy.com/course/net-core-microservices-the-complete-guide-net-6-mvc/).

## 1.2. Deviations

- Decided to write the web components with Razor Pages (instead of MVC, as used during the course). Has allowed me to customise the solution somewhat.
